An Educated Workforce,211,College attainment gap for Black or African American compared to White working age adults,"Economy, Education","While college attainment rates have improved for all racial and ethnic groups over the past decade, stubborn gaps in education attainment persist and have worsened since the year 2000. The college attainment gap (the percentage point difference in working age adults with a 2- or 4-year college degree) between Black and White adults is 23 points, up from 21 points in 2000; between Latinos and Whites the gap is 33 points, up from 30 points in 2000. Within racial and ethnic groups, attainment varies depending on spatial location. For example, educational attainment for Asians is, on average higher than that of Whites by 7 points regionally, but Asians living in Regional Urban Centers have a college attainment rate 36 percentage points below Asians living in Suburbs. The gap in educational attainment between Regional Urban Centers and the regional average is 16 points. Generally, residents of suburban communities have the highest rates of college degree attainment, although for Whites, the rate is highest in Urban Core communities. Metro Boston’s educational attainment gap by race is greater than the national average across all races, although for Asians, college attainment exceeds that of Whites in Metro Boston and the nation. Metro Boston has the 3rd highest college attainment gap of the top 25 U.S. metro areas for Blacks, 7th highest for Latinos, and 7th highest for those who identify as multiracial or another race. 

These college attainment gaps have long-term implications for economic equity and prosperity in our region. While the data does show increased college attainment across community types, races and ethnicities, we still must strive to close these gaps to ensure that our increasingly diverse Metro Boston residents are prepared for the knowledge-based jobs that are expanding in the region, and to be sure that businesses looking to locate in our region consider Regional Urban Centers as viable places to set up shop.","37, 38"

An Educated Workforce,218,Debt-to-degree ratio for all Metro Boston undergraduate institutions,"Economy, Education","Metro Boston is making great strides in increasing its college graduation rate, but an undergraduate degree comes at a cost. In today’s economy, unemployment is up across all educational attainment groups, so even workers with a college degree are more than twice as likely to be unemployed today as they were in 2000. There are also students who enroll in college and take on debt, but are unable to graduate for any number of reasons. Without the advantage of having a degree, the cost of debt becomes an even greater effective burden. Dropping out of a degree program, or taking longer than is standard to graduate, commonly leads to increased debt, lower-wage employment and higher likelihood of defaulting on loans.  

There are roughly 100 colleges and universities in the Metro Boston region. In 2012, students from these institutions received nearly 49,000 undergraduate degrees and incurred more than $736 million in federal student loan debt—a debt-to-degree ratio of $15,000, slightly higher than the national average of $14,300. 
This high debt-to-degree ratio is a problem across all higher education sectors—private non-profit, private for-profit, public, two-year and four-year institutions—but there are differing trends among sectors. Overall, the highest federal loan debts are accrued at four-year for-profit schools: an average of $35,000 per degree for the years 2010 to 2012. The largest increase, however, in debt-to-degree ratio from 2007-2009 to 2010-2012 occurred in the state’s public colleges and universities, at 30%. The debt-to-degree ratio for Massachusetts four-year public undergraduate institutions is now $24,000, for years 2010 to 2012, and exceeds that of four-year private non-profit undergraduate colleges and universities. In contrast, the debt-to-degree ratios for for-profit and private institutions have dropped over the same interval, by 5% and 20% respectively.  The factors influencing the debt-to-degree ratio are complex—tuition, scholarships, enrollment, dropout, and graduation rates all influence the final debt-load metric. Metro Boston institutions must work to keep tuition costs in check while making scholarships available to those in need, and simultaneously increase student retention for our schools to adequately serve the region’s students.  

Ultimately, since more students are relying on our state’s public colleges and universities, where enrollment is up 24% since 2007, for their higher education, keeping those degrees affordable for all Massachusetts students will be a crucial component of the region’s prosperity in years to come. Already many institutions are working to keep costs in check while providing the necessary tools and supports to overcome barriers to timely graduation. For our young adults to be prosperous now and into the future, they must not only be able to attain a high-quality post-secondary education, but they must be able to afford to pay off their student loans throughout the 10+ year loan repayment period.","37, 38"

A Diverse and Productive Workforce,237,"Gap between alternative unemployment rate (including workers who are marginally attached and part-time for economic reasons) and official unemployment rate, Massachusetts",Economy,"In addition to the official unemployment rate, the Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates alternative measures of labor underutilization, including the rate of unemployed plus all marginally attached workers, and workers employed part time for economic reasons.  These labor underutilization rates are important to gauge the magnitude of adults who are unemployed or underemployed but are not considered in the official unemployment rate, either because they are not counted as part of the labor force, as in the case of marginally attached workers, or are counted as employed even if they would prefer full time work, as in the case of part time workers for economic reasons. In 2013 this underutilization rate (U-6) was 13.2% - 6.2 percentage points higher than the official unemployment rate. In 2003, it was 3.2 points higher than the official rate. The increase in the gap of underutilization to unemployment indicates that today more people are discouraged about finding a job and are dropping out of the labor force, or are working reduced hours when they’d prefer to work full time, relative to the population, than they were in 2003, even as the official unemployment rate is up over that same time.
The underutilization gap held relatively steady between 2003 and 2007, then jumped up between 2008 and 2009, during the Great Recession, when the official unemployment rate (U-3) went up by 3 percentage points and the underutilization rate (U-6) went up by 5.5 percentage points. The gap has remained up around 6 points since 2009, indicating that there are potentially still a lot of workers working fewer hours due to economic reasons. Of course, the gap would decrease if the underutilization rate held steady and the unemployment rate went up, so it is important to watch the trends of all three indicators – official unemployment rate, underutilization rate, and the gap between the two. Relative to the rest of the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, Massachusetts ranks around the middle for all three of these measures.",39
A Diverse and Productive Workforce,240,"Gap between total employment and number of workers in the labor force, high skill workers",Economy,"In addition to ensuring that the region’s residents have low unemployment overall, it is important that workers be employed in jobs that fit their educational qualifications. As residents of Metro Boston continue to raise their levels of educational attainment and invest in getting college and graduate degrees, the region must work to attract jobs that can employ these highly educated workers. Currently, although the proportion of high skill jobs is increasing as a share of total employment, the region still cannot support the number of workers with bachelor’s and advanced degrees. In the high skill job category, there are over 383,000 more qualified workers than there are jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher. On the other hand, there are more workers employed in jobs requiring some college or an associate’s degree than there are workers with that level of education. This surplus of mid-skill jobs, combined with the relatively low unemployment rate of highly educated workers, could indicate that a certain number higher skill workers are employed in jobs that require a lower level of education than they possess. In the low skill job category, those requiring a high school diploma or less, there is a surplus of 2,000 jobs, which is within the margin of error and indicates a relative balance of workers to jobs. The fact, however, that unemployment among workers with lower educational attainment is significantly higher than for those with mid- and high-level educations, suggests that overqualified workers are filling these jobs as well. 
Overall job market recovery and continued growth of high-skill jobs would help close the high-skill employment gap by opening up more high-education employment opportunities for Metro Boston workers with college degrees.

Equitable Prosperity,262,"Massachusetts' ratio of taxes paid to family income, rich (top 1%) to poor (lowest 20%)","Economy, Equity","Contrary to popular belief, the effective rate of Massachusetts state and local taxes is lower than the national average, but like the rest of the states, our tax system is regressive, meaning poorer families pay a larger share of their incomes in taxes than richer families.  Currently, Massachusetts’ poorest families, those with incomes in the lowest 20%, pay more than twice as much of their income in taxes as do its richest families, those with incomes in the top 1%.  The tax system has not become more or less progressive since 1996.
Our state income tax rate is flat, which means the code is neither progressive nor regressive, but because it includes certain credits and a lower limit on income levels subject to state tax, the wealthiest families pay a higher percent of their income in income tax than the poorest families. Property taxes and Sales and Excise taxes, however, disproportionately burden lower income families.  The cigarette tax provides a clear example of this effect. Because cigarette taxes are charged per pack, a low-income smoker will pay a much higher share of his or her income in cigarette taxes than a higher-income smoker. This particular tax has been raised several times in Massachusetts, most recently by $1 per pack in 2013.  
Between 1996 and 2003, the state and local tax burden as a share of income decreased across all income groups, primarily because of a drop in the income tax rate from 5.96% to 5.3%.  The rate has since dropped to 5.25%.  The overall tax burden rebounded a bit between 2003 and 2007, which is due to an increase in property taxes as a share of income.  This change may have been due more to an increase in property value outstripping income increases over those years rather than a change in local property tax codes. The residential property tax rate in Boston, for example, actually decreased from $11.29 to $10.99 per $1,000 of value between 2003 and 2007.  The total amount of residential tax collected in Boston jumped 63% during those years, while the number of residential parcels assessed only increased 6%.",

The long-term implications of such pronounced gaps in unemployment are not good for the region. Racial gaps, especially, are troubling for our region, which is becoming more diverse every year. While trends show increased educational attainment across races, which should fare well for regional employment in knowledge-based jobs, discriminatory hiring limits opportunity for residents of color who are qualified for those jobs, and imposes an artificial limit on the applicant pool from which employers have to draw from.","38, 39"
A Diverse and Productive Workforce,234,"Unemployment Gap, No High School Diploma to College Degree",Economy,"Unemployment gaps by educational attainment, race and ethnicity, and community type have remained stubbornly persistent, with no definitive movement since 2000. Educational attainment is a significant factor in employment outcomes in the region – for an adult in the region without a college degree, the unemployment rate is double that of an adult with a college degree; for an adult without a high school diploma it is triple. Race also plays a significant role in employment outcomes, especially for Black residents: the unemployment rate for Blacks in the region is 6 points higher than that of Whites, a larger gap than 2000’s 4 points. Across all educational attainment levels, Blacks have the highest rate of unemployment of any race or ethnicity. This points to troubling and persistent discrimination in employment practices.  The unemployment gap between Latino and White Metro Boston adults has closed a marginal 1 point, from 4 points in 2000 to 3. 
Metro Boston’s unemployment rate for adults ages 16 and older  is lower than the national average for Whites and Blacks, but higher for Latinos and Asians. The unemployment gap between Black adults ages 16 and over in Metro Boston is 0.3 percentage points lower than it is for the nation overall. For Latinos, the gap is 2.2 points greater than that of the nation. Metro Boston has the second largest unemployment gap between Latinos and Whites, out of the 25 most populous U.S. metros.
