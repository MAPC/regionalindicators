An Educated Workforce,"Metro Boston will never have the cheapest energy or the biggest port—an educated workforce is our competitive edge. Metro Boston is known for our world-class workforce with a strong supply of skilled and educated workers. Among the 100 most populous metropolitan areas in the U.S., Metro Boston ranks 7th in share of adults over 25 years of age with a 2- or 4-year college degree. Businesses, especially those in high-skill industries, such as education and health services, finance, information, and professional and business services, are thriving in our region, where employment in those sectors is 47% of regional employment – 11 percentage points above the national average.
  
Yet the region must work to maintain this competitive edge. According to MAPC’s 2014 population projections , one million workers now over the age of 40—nearly 40% of the workforce—will have left the region’s labor force by 2030, and skilled, educated workers must be available to fill those jobs if they are to remain in the region. The innovative industries driving the region’s growth thrive with a steady supply of college graduates. Unfortunately, the region is losing these workers to other parts of the country; from 2000 to 2010, there was a net loss of 65,000 residents who were between the ages of 25 and 40 at the beginning of the decade, a net loss of 6%.  Greater retention of skilled workers is a critical pathway to a more robust workforce. Another critical pathway to a more competitive workforce is eliminating stubborn gaps in educational attainment across race and ethnicity that limit opportunities for Metro Boston’s residents of color to fully participate in the region’s labor market. A prosperous region is one where all of our young people have access to a high quality education and are able to achieve a level of educational attainment that leads to gainful employment and a livable wage. Workers of all ages should have the opportunity and flexibility to be lifelong learners – upgrading skills and advancing career paths is more important now than it ever was, in order to adapt to Metro Boston’s increasingly knowledge-based economy.

As residents of Metro Boston become more educated, it is important to track the cost of that education. There is no doubt about the life-long advantages that come along with a college degree – higher labor force participation, lower unemployment, higher income, better ability to build wealth – but student debt can eat into those advantages, especially when the average Metro Boston undergraduate student takes on $15,000 of debt to gain a degree. 

To maintain its economic edge and advance opportunities for more equitable prosperity, the region must work to continue advancing higher educational attainment rates while keeping the relative cost of that education in check. It is especially refocus investment in public universities, which have traditionally offered Massachusetts residents an accessible and affordable track to a college degree."
Equitable Prosperity,"A prosperous Metro Boston is one in which all of our residents are able to participate fully in our economy. Metro Boston families should be financially stable and able to build wealth for the future. The reality, however, is that thousands of Metro Boston households live below the federal poverty threshold, and many more thousands that do not have enough income to support themselves independently. The region’s income disparity is among the top in the nation, and our taxes burden lower-income families at a higher rate than higher-income families.
The capacity to build wealth is important for long-term individual and family economic stability. A family’s wealth – its assets minus its debts – is the key to its long-term prosperity. Income above that needed to live off can be saved and invested for retirement, college tuition, and business ventures, or used as a safety net for health emergencies and other unforeseen expenses. In turn, the financial security of families is essential to the financial security of the region. When Metro Boston residents have a comfortable financial cushion, they are more active participants in the regional economy – they can buy real estate, patronize local businesses, invest in new businesses, and contribute more to the tax base. Yet, national studies show that the capacity to build wealth is not equal across racial and ethnic lines. According to analysis of a 25-year study by researchers at Brandeis University, the national racial wealth gap between White and African American families grew $152,000 between 1984 and 2009.  The analysis found that the top factors influencing this gap in wealth accumulation are number of years of homeownership, accounting for 27% of the gap; family income (20%); unemployment (9%); attainment of college degree (5%); and inheritance and financial support from family (5%).  In Metro Boston, the four of these metrics that we are able to measure – homeownership, family income, unemployment, and college degree attainment – show racial disparities greater than that of the nation. This indicates that the barriers to wealth building for families of color in Metro Boston are in fact greater than they are for families of color in the nation overall. Persistent structural inequities in Metro Boston limit opportunities for families of color, and in turn limit the overall prosperity of the region."
